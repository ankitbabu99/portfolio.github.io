<h1>Internship</h1>
<p>
Eightfold Design is a fairly new company, operating in Marin County as a website design firm.
 Founded by Hasan Tas sume, Eightfold performs a wide array of digital work for businesses looking for improvement in design aspects.
 The company uses simplicity and clean looks to address the clients requests. 
 Hasan, my supervisor and was overall the one giving me instruction on tasks.
 He operates the complete company and works for himself, proving to be extremely talented in the given field.
 Eightfold is run from his home and acts as the main office for work along with our meetings.
 The internship task was to collaborate with Hasan and work along with him regarding design models for clients. 
 A lot of the work presented delved into HTML and CSS, which was new to me at the time. Never the less, I was eager to learn and work.
 <br>As an intern, my work consisted of creating and designing web layouts, which then would be submitted to Hasan.
 Discussion was also apart of the work seeing as how investigation is key when coming up with the best design. 
 Work was transferred and discussed through email and other digital forms of communication.
 Hasans office was too far away to travel when worked was assigned or in a daily manner.
 During occasion we would meet at his house to converse regarding work. 
 However, the programs required to complete work were all on my computer and a portion of them I was already familiar with.
 The position didn't involve communication with others apart from Hasan. 
 The work was rather independent, although I learn best (strictly on design programs) alone and
 was able to spend time getting even more familiar with programs along with certain tools.
 For example, the most common program was adobe Illustrator and proved to be an excellent instrument when constructing wireframes.
 Photoshop came in handy too whenever something couldnt be achieved over Illustrator alone.
 My perception on how to use these programs was something that constantly changed.
 Apart from work and as school progressed, time was devoted to learning more about graphic design as a whole.
