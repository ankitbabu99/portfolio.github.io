<h1>Personal Statement</h1>
<p>High school is one of those rare experiences where one determines much about themselves, proving an imperative practice that all students should enjoy.
 Seeing as how senior year is coming to a close, reflection poses an opportunity to examine ones self.
 This last year has brought many things to light in the categories of academics, character, and the future.</p>
 <p>From an early age, I noticed it was difficult to perform proficient in core classes such as English and Math.
 In fact subjects that involve only one answer to problems, strict processes, or uncreative characteristics typically were challenging to me. 
 iit helped in this aspect, founding their lessons on project based learning thus enabling a different learning experience.
 The ability to work in partnership aided me in understanding coursework and content.
 iit in general changes students into young adults that gain the ability to function in society and the real world workplace.</p>
 <p>One of the most important aspects of creating a good life for yourself is that you are a good student. I feel that I am as good as a student as anyone can be. I have this drive during school that is like no other. I set goals for myself like completing all work, tests, and projects to the best of my ability. I think this ambition comes from the fact that I want to be as successful as my sister was during her high school career. Being an overall hardworking student is what I strive for. I feel that if i get this than I can get to any college I plan for.
