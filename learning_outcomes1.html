<h1>Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>- Career Preparation</p>
<p>An aspiring Art Director needs embankments of experience in a variety of design fields. Being rather young, genuine experience is hard to come by. Never the less, an illustrious position arose at Video In a Minute, a Local Napa Valley video editing company. I've been employed there for a few months now and this is just the type of valuable experience needed. Learning from an expert and the CEO Lisa Gottried, I've completed selected projects for her and have countless projects on the road ahead. The video editor position entails controlling fragments of footage, tying them together in order to create a story and adjust audio components. Another beneficial factor in working at VIAM dwells into constructive criticism. Numerous professions call for taking criticism, however especially in media art fields. For each project thats embarked on 2 or 3 sessions of criticism are held. These sittings assure the best quality and acting upon criticism is something gained. Working at VIAM is imperative; it's rich with experience thats relevant to a major goal and most importantly I'm happy working there.&nbsp;</p><p>- Citizenship and Ethics</p><p>Being a New Tech student, citizenship and ethics teach themselves given our project based learning characteristics and the sense of reasonability, respect, and trust found in our hallways. Despite these, the Tours at New Tech club assisted with adding extra means to this outcome. This is a club, not a class and members want to join for the riveting feeling of pride in giving tours for their school. Being a 3-year veteran and the president for 2010 to 2011 year, TNT was quite a focus in my high school years. Each member had to represent the school professionally and know relatively a lot about classes, grades, project based learning, requirements, ect. Some tours required professional clothing and the upmost positive attitude when guiding people around. Most tours were conducted during class time and meant the student had to be ahead. This club was an accurate way in expressing the morals of New Tech and how active one can be within the school.</p><p>- Collaboration</p><p>Any number of examples arise from New Tech that precisely display collaboration, however the most unique example is also the most outlandish. The Mr. President project preformed this year involved 3/4 of the school, changed where most students would customarily go to class, and addressed a single goal. The task was to single out one problem with the American education system and create a solution. This problem could have been anything, but it was for the student groups to decide. Examples and facts of this problem also had to be presented in an ordered manner, however the strangest groups were formed. The average group consisted of one senior, one junior, and one freshman. Working with different grades on the same project was something never conducted before and proved to be an excellent change from the regular. Each member had far different levels of skill and had different assignments to compensate. We had to work as a team knowing each other was a grade higher or lower than we were. The following work was a leter assignment thatl pertains to the project, the topic the letter covers was formed with the groups attention. This type of collaboration stands out from others given the grade placement and how action was taken. &nbsp;</p><p>Example:</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B6NfNU0EsT-7ZDc1NjUzOTktOGNjMS00NDE0LWFjMWItYmQyNWMzYjY3NTM3&hl=en&authkey=COKA2N4D">https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B6NfNU0EsT-7ZDc1NjUzOTktOGNjMS00NDE0LWFjMWItYmQyNWMzYjY3NTM3&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=COKA2N4D</a></p><p>- Critical Thinking</p><p>Nearly every project at New Tech involved this deep level of understanding and thought as well as it's utilization to the task. The WW2 book project in sophomore year required the most focus and direction. The project was rather large for 10th graders and looking back on this assignment it doesn&rsquo;t pose much of a challenge now. Never the less, groups of two were required to make an illustrated story based off of a reading we were consigned. Each member had a specific role, either a writer or an illustrator. Being particularly absorbed in art this year and eagerly waiting a project that called for artistic skill, the illustrator role drastically spoke to me. I was teamed with an exceptional writer, Nektaria Baker who handled all the inscription portions. Our illustrated story &ldquo;Bread and Ashes&rdquo; was based off of Hassle and Gretel. It took massive amounts of focus to translate the writing and story into illustrations. There were 8 illustrations in total, however each had 1 or 2 drafts before the final piece was created. The amount of drawling was equitant to the amount of reading, turning words on pages into lines, landscapes, faces, and bodies. Translation of mood also played a major role how things were exemplified from text to image. Overall the project was very creative and interesting yet still it took much time and patients, high expectations for sophomores.</p><p>Example:</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjpsV_kfnQt5AoaHNSoXcKa5icRjZJNm2Dlv9GxN6jE/edit?hl=en&authkey=CPHyvpwC">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjpsV_kfnQt5AoaHNSoXcKa5icRjZJNm2Dlv9GxN6jE/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CPHyvpwC</a></p><p>- Circular Literacy</p>
          <p>High school work is challenging to any student and course work only gets harder as time progresses. I've always been a positive student, a student that wants to learn and do well. Despite these intensions school has always been rough with very little coming easy, which is life. The two most important subjects are also the same subjects I struggled in most. Even thought these subjects speak to almost every profession around, from a personal and academic stand point English is far too strict and Mathematical problems and equations have only one answer which is too precise. I have never taken any class lightheartedly or without care. For the majority of 9th and 10th grade, grades consisted of either C's or B's, once 11th and 12th grade was reached grades changed to B's and A's. This transform arose from having a goal. During the end of sophomore year I set a firm concentration on design related careers in my Digital Media 1 course. From setting this concentration and forming my future within mind, more vigor and absorption was place on every class. Art, Digital Media, and digital art classes have always been favored and have always shown advanced grades.</p>

          <p>- Oral Communication</p>
          <p>The most exciting project, out of 4 years of high school education was by far the Great Gatsby project in American studies, the junior humanities class. The point was to create a scene from the plot of the Great Gatsby and then perform live. Acting teams were formed and roles were taken based on the characters from the novel. It was important that actors made historical references in their parts and portrayed their characters accurately. I played Gatsby and spend hours working on his attitude, character, style, and emotion from the story. My communication score was 48/50 and received the Most Dramatic Death Award. Acting and improve are hobbies and having a project that focused on them while following a plot from F Scott Fitzgerald defiantly proved to be the most outstanding project.          </p>

          <p>- Written Communication</p>
          <p>The number of large writing assignments and essays encountered at New Tech is overwhelming. One of the most exceptional assignments was the CRBIBS Real-Estate project in Political Studies. The end mission was to create a list of recommendations, investments, and buying strategies for a single consigned family. The group spend days looking for the best deal for our family and put massive amounts of concentration making sure the houses fit their needs and wants. Our written communication grade received an advanced evaluation. The challenge this project posed was assembling all the writing and then combining the work of four people together. The writing had to be the upmost professional and the same type one would find reading an authentic housing recommendation. Overall the team did well and was a major written communication victory.&nbsp; </p>

          <p>- Technology literacy</p>
          <p>Almost every project on campus has a technology component; dozens of examples could have been used. However the most rewarding class taken this year was Digital Media 2 and each project undertaken seemed so rewarding. This class has taught me so much and the amount of respect I have to the instructor Dr. (Mr.) Brown is mountainous. This class gave me insight and experience to important programs that are the reason why I have my current job at VIAM. </p>
